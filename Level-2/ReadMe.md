# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis – Level 2 (Cognifyz Internship)

## 📌 Description

This folder contains my solutions for **Level 2** of the **Cognifyz Technologies Data Analysis Internship**.  
The focus of Level 2 is **deeper exploratory analysis** of the restaurant dataset, including cuisine combinations, geographic distribution, and restaurant chains.

The analysis is performed using **Python** with pandas and matplotlib.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Level-2 analysis includes:

- **Restaurant Ratings Analysis** – Understanding rating distribution and average votes  
- **Cuisine Combinations** – Identifying common cuisine combinations and their ratings  
- **Geographic Analysis** – Visualizing restaurant locations using latitude and longitude  
- **Restaurant Chains** – Identifying chains and analyzing their ratings and popularity  

Each task is implemented in a **separate Python script**.

## 📂 Data Source

The dataset is provided as part of the **Cognifyz Internship Programme** and contains:

- Restaurant names and cities  
- Cuisines (single and multiple)  
- Aggregate ratings and votes  
- Price range  
- Online delivery and table booking flags  
- Latitude and longitude coordinates

## 💡 Business Problem

For food platforms and restaurant businesses, it is important to:

- Understand how ratings are distributed and how much customer engagement (votes) restaurants receive  
- Know which **cuisine combinations** are most popular and better rated  
- Identify **geographic clusters** of restaurants  
- Analyze the performance and popularity of **restaurant chains**  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives (Level 2)

- **Task 1 – Restaurant Ratings:**  
  Analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings and calculate the average number of votes.

- **Task 2 – Cuisine Combinations:**  
  Identify the most common cuisine combinations and analyze their average ratings.

- **Task 3 – Geographic Analysis:**  
  Plot restaurant locations using latitude and longitude and identify clustering patterns.

- **Task 4 – Restaurant Chains:**  
  Identify restaurant chains and analyze their ratings and popularity using votes.

## 🔍 Steps Followed

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
   - Loaded the dataset using pandas.  
   - Inspected columns related to ratings, cuisines, votes, and location.

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Processed multi-value cuisine fields.  
   - Handled missing values where required.  
   - Ensured numeric fields (ratings, votes, coordinates) were in correct format.

3. **Analysis & Visualization**  
   - Used grouping, aggregation, and sorting for insights.  
   - Created visualizations to understand distributions, combinations, and geographic patterns.

## 📈 Key Findings (Level 2)

### ⭐ Restaurant Ratings
- Ratings are mostly concentrated in the **mid-range (around 2.5 to 4.0)**.  
- The average number of votes per restaurant provides a measure of customer engagement.

### 🍽️ Cuisine Combinations
- Multi-cuisine combinations like **North Indian & Chinese** appear frequently.  
- Some cuisine combinations show **higher average ratings** than single-cuisine listings.

### 🌍 Geographic Analysis
- Restaurants are **not evenly distributed**.  
- Dense clusters appear around **major cities and urban areas**, indicating higher market concentration.

### 🏪 Restaurant Chains
- Well-known chains (e.g., Cafe Coffee Day, Domino’s, Subway, etc.) appear multiple times.  
- Chains differ in **average ratings and popularity (votes)**, showing variation in customer preference.
